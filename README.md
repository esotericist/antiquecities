# antiquecities
compatibility mod for antique atlas and lost cities

it isn't pretty as pretty as it could, it doesn't support all of the lost cities things, but it's more than we had to begin with.

as of 1.1, it is server safe.

# currently supported

*  streets
*  buildings (with a range of sizes)
*  train stations
*  downard rail sections adjacent to train stations

# in progress

*  ruin levels (assets created, logic incomplete)
*  telling parks from streets (API limitation, can be worked around with effort like with the rails)

# currently unsupported but planned

*  highways or bridges (API limitation)

# important notes

moving to new versions of antique cities with additional features also won't work right unless you create a new world.

in theory, retrogen is possible, but it may be beyond my ability (or beyond my motivation
